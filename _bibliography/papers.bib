abstract="The successful application and reported robustness of Mutual Information
both in rigid and nonrigid image registration over the last decades gave
rise to an ongoing research on other information based similarity metrics
emanating from Renyi Divergence. To the best of our knowledge however, this
is the first paper studying the effects of Renyi parameter in combination
with a subsampling factor in image registration accuracy. To this end, a
series of experiments are presented with respect to the effect of Renyi's
parameter and the subsampling factor in registration accuracy. Our results
show that the increase of the Renyi parameter and the percentage of the
pixels used leads, on average, to the reduction of the registration error."

abstract="COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented healthcare crisis with millions of infected people across the globe often pushing infrastructures, healthcare workers and entire economies beyond their limits. The scarcity of testing kits, even in developed countries, has led to extensive research efforts towards alternative solutions with high sensitivity. Chest radiological imaging paired with artificial intelligence (AI) can offer significant advantages in diagnosis of novel coronavirus infected patients. To this end, transfer learning techniques are used for overcoming the limitations emanating from the lack of relevant big datasets, enabling specialized models to converge on limited data, as in the case of X‑rays of COVID‑19 patients. In this study, we present an interpretable AI framework assessed by expert radiologists on the basis on how well the attention maps focus on the diagnostically‑relevant image regions. The proposed transfer learning methodology achieves an overall area under the curve of 1 for a binary classification problem across a 5‑fold training/testing dataset."}

  abstract="The coronavirus pandemic and its unprecedented consequences globally has spurred the interest of the artificial intelligence research community. A plethora of published studies have investigated the role of imaging such as chest X‑rays and computer tomography in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) automated diagnosis. Οpen repositories of medical imaging data can play a significant role by promoting cooperation among institutes in a world‑wide scale. However, they may induce limitations related to variable data quality and intrinsic differences due to the wide variety of scanner vendors and imaging parameters. In this study, a state‑of‑the‑art custom U‑Net model is presented with a dice similarity coefficient performance of 99.6% along with a transfer learning VGG‑19 based model for COVID‑19 versus pneumonia differentiation exhibiting an area under curve of 96.1%. The above was significantly improved over the baseline model trained with no segmentation in selected tomographic slices of the same dataset. The presented study highlights the importance of a robust preprocessing protocol for image analysis within a heterogeneous imaging dataset and assesses the potential diagnostic value of the presented COVID‑19 model by comparing its performance to the state of the art."
