      I joined CBML on October 2019 after I graduated from the University of Patras. I have worked on several EU funded projects, such as <a href="https://www.see-far.eu/">SeeFar</a>, <a href="https://insilc.eu/">InSilc</a> and <a href="https://timely-project.eu/Home/">Timely</a>. I have worked on medical image registration on IVUS and OCT intravascular images and deep learning analysis of retina fundus images. In addition, I have worked on chest X-Ray images for COVID-19 detection using deep learning. Our paper “Interpretable artificial intelligence framework for COVID‑19 screening on chest X‑rays” received the gold award at the Healthcare Business Awards 2020. My interests relate to medical image analysis, deep learning, statistics and biomedical engineering in general. I have also started working on computational pathology for breast cancer, after a short research visit at <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/theodoros-foukakis">Prof. Foukakis</a> group at Karolinska Insitutet in Sept. 2021.
