I am a Research Software Engineer in the [Computational BioMedicine Laboratory](https://www.ics.forth.gr/cbml), at the Institute of Computer Science, Foundation of Research and Technology - Hellas.

My main areas of interest relate to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Science, Image Processing, Computer Vision and Biomedical Engineering.

Aside from academic work, I love developing side projects which usually have to do with Smart Home applications, my Homelab (Linux Desktop & Home Server and Networking).

I also enjoy hiking and outdoors activities, playing basketball, tennis and walking around the city. I love travelling around the world and getting to know new cultures, people, cities and the nature.
