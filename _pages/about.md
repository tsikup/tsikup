I am a PhD candidate at the department of Oncology-Pathology at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se) in Sweden. My research focuses on developing novel artificial intelligence and especially deep learning methods based on H&amp;E-stained tissue images for improving prognostication and therapy response in breast cancer. 

I have obtained a Master of Engineering degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.upatras.gr) at the University of Patras in 2019. Following my undergraduate studies, I worked for two and a half years as research assistant at the [Computational BioMedicine Laboratory](https://www.ics.forth.gr/cbml) of the Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology â€“ Hellas. I have been involved in several EU Horizon 2020 funded programs, working on medical image analysis and deep learning.

My main areas of interest relate to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Image Processing in Medicine and especially Computational Pathology. You can find all my published articles in my [scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=vWYykXgAAAAJ&hl=en) and in [publications](/articles) page.

Aside from academic work, I develop smart home applications and linux homelab projects. I also enjoy hiking and outdoors activities, playing basketball, tennis and travelling around the world.
