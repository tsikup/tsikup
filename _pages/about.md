I am a Research Software Engineer at the [Computational BioMedicine Laboratory](https://www.ics.forth.gr/cbml) of the Institute of Computer Science, Foundation of Research and Technology - Hellas.

My main areas of interest relate to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Image Processing in Medicine and especially Digital Pathology. You can find all my published articles in my [scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=vWYykXgAAAAJ&hl=en) and in [publications](/articles) page.

Aside from academic work, I develop smart home applications and linux homelab projects. I also enjoy hiking and outdoors activities, playing basketball, tennis and travelling around the world.
