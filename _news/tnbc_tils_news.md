Our research team has published a comprehensive study evaluating the analytical and clinical validity of different AI algorithms for scoring Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). This work addresses a critical question in computational pathology: whether different machine learning models can be used interchangeably for TILs assessment. The study provides valuable insights into the standardization and reliability of AI-based TILs scoring, which is crucial for clinical decision-making in TNBC treatment.
