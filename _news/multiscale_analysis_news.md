We have developed a novel model-agnostic multiscale analysis framework that significantly enhances the performance of AI models in breast cancer histopathology image analysis. This approach allows for better understanding and improvement of AI models by analyzing their behavior across different spatial scales. The framework has shown promising results in improving model interpretability and performance, potentially leading to more reliable AI-assisted diagnosis in breast cancer pathology.
