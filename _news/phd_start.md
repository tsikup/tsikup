It's my pleasure to announce that I have been admitted to the department of Oncology-Pathology at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se) to study for my PhD degree in AI-assisted computational pathology. My PhD project related to the development and application of novel AI and DL models on H&E-stained images of tissue sections for improving prognostication and therapy response in breast cancer.
